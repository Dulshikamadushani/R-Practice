# Explain the following concepts about ggplot 

# a. What three elements do you need to produce a ggplot?
# a dataset 
# aesthetic mappings (aes)
# geometric objects (geoms) 

# b. What is a geom? 
# A geom (geometric object) is the visual representation of data in a plot. Ex:
# geom_boxplot() → boxplot
# geom_bar() → bar chart
# geom_point() → scatter plot

# c. What is a facet? 
# A facet splits a plot into multiple panels based on a categorical variable, therefore can compare groups easily.

# d. Explain the concept of layering. 
# Layering means building a plot by adding components one at a time using + operation.

# e. Where do you add x and y variables and map different shapes, colors, and other attributes to the data? 
# Inside the aes() function.
